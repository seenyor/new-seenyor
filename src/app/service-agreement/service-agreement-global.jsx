        <li>Alert Service</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Seenyor Device sends fall alerts directly to designated contacts

        Alerts are sent through the Seenyor system and are dependent on a stable
        internet connection. Seenyor assumes no liability for any issues arising
        from connectivity interruptions or other limitations affecting alert
        delivery. By using this device, you release Seenyor from any claims,
        losses, or damages that may arise due to delays, interruptions, or
        failures in alert transmission.

        please note that if the Device is not connected to Wi-Fi, if the Wi-Fi
        is interrupted, or if there is no internet access, the Device will be
        unable to communicate with the Application or your smartphone, and
        alerts will not be sent. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING WI-FI
        AND NETWORK ACCESS AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE. SEENYOR ACCEPTS NO

        If you download the Application from the Apple App Store (or if it is an
        iOS application), then, without limiting the disclaimers of warranty and
        liability limitations set forth in this Agreement:
      </p>
      <p>(i) You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <p>
        (a) This Agreement is between you and Seenyor only, not with Apple.
        Seenyor and its licensors, not Apple, are solely responsible for the
        Application and its content.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Your use of the Application is also subject to the Usage Rules
        established by Apple, including those outlined in the Apple App Store
        Terms of Service, effective as of the date you enter into this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) The license granted here is limited to a non-transferable right to
        use the Application on an Apple iPhone, iPad, or other Apple-branded
        device that you own or control, which runs the iOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Seenyor alone is responsible for providing any maintenance and
        support services related to the Application, as specified in this
        Agreement or as required under applicable law. Apple has no obligation
        to provide any maintenance or support services for the Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        (e) Seenyor is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether
        express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. In
        case the Application does not conform to an applicable warranty, you may
        notify Apple, and Apple will, if applicable, refund any purchase price
        paid for the Application. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple
        has no other warranty obligations for the Application, and any claims,
        losses, or costs arising from failure to conform to a warranty are
        Seenyor’s responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        (f) Seenyor, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims related
        to the Application or your possession and use of it, including but not
        limited to (a) product liability claims, (b) claims that the Application
        fails to meet any legal or regulatory requirements, and (c) claims
        arising under consumer protection laws, including those related to the
        Application’s use of HealthKit and HomeKit frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        (g) If a third party claims that the Application or your possession and
        use of it infringes their intellectual property rights, Apple is not
        responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of
        such a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        (h) Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this
        Agreement. Upon your acceptance of this Agreement’s terms and
        conditions, Apple will have the right (and is deemed to have accepted
        the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party
        beneficiary.
