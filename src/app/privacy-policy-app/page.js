        <p>
          If Seenyor.com offers any product or account connections or
          integrations with partner products, applications, functionality, or
          services (collectively, “Partner Products and Services”), and you
          choose to enable or connect to such Partner Products and Services
          through the means authorized and directed by Seenyor.com and/or such
          partners, you acknowledge and agree that we may share certain Personal
          Information about you with those partners. This sharing is done for
          purposes such as account authentication and management and to enable
          the activation, integration, and connection with such Partner Products
          and Services on the partners’ platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you choose to use Partner Products and Services, like
          those that may be offered by Seenyor.com in collaboration with
          third-party providers, you agree that we may share certain data about
          you with those partners to enable the activation, connection, and
          integration with the Partner Products and Services you intend to use
          or have chosen to activate. In some cases, Seenyor.com or the partner
          may ask for your permission to control the Seenyor products and
          services and/or Partner Products and Services you have activated and
          connected to. Your consent is required to allow these exchanges or
          requests for control, and you will be able to revoke or disable this
          consent at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Seenyor.com may share Personal Information with partners
          with your explicit permission. For instance, when you enroll in or
          activate Partner Products and Services, you may be asked for your
          permission to share certain data between Seenyor.com and our partner.
          Seenyor.com requires your consent before sharing Personal Information
          in these scenarios. We may also receive information from our partners
          and other sources and combine it with the Personal Information in your
          Seenyor.com account to assess eligibility and the effectiveness of our
          programs.
        </p>

          by that partner’s privacy policy.

        <p>
          We may offer programs such as contests, surveys, or other similar

          information, we may offer you financial incentives and/or price or
          service differences such as a discount or a coupon. You can terminate
          participation at any time as explained in the applicable Promotional
          Campaign terms. We estimate that the value of the Personal Information
          we collect for Promotional Campaigns is the value of the benefit we
          offer to you in connection with the promotion, which is reasonably
          related to the costs associated with offering such a benefit.

          determine our retention periods include: (a) the length of time we
          have an ongoing relationship with our customers and provide services,
          (b) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, and
          (c) whether retention is necessary to support our legal position (such
          as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or
          regulatory investigations).
