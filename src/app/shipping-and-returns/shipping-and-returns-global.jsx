            <br />
            Once your order is placed and payment is successfully processed, our
            sales team will coordinate the installation with you. Your
            installation will be scheduled after the mandatory cooling-off
            period. Our professional installers will then install the device at
            your location. Once installed, the service will be activated and
            cannot be canceled.

      <h4 dir="ltr">Cancellation Before Installation</h4>

        If Seenyor equipment is lost or damaged before installation, customers
        must report it to Seenyor immediately. A replacement fee of up to $450
        AUD may apply per device. If any equipment is damaged post-installation
        due to misuse, customers may be responsible for the cost of replacement.
